Fitness Studio##

Fitness studio is a website that provides an existing or expected client information about the facilities and coaches of a gym and provides details on upcoming events and classes.
For this sites demographic it will be targeting both professional athletes and hobbyists that want a sense of community and mutually understanding and safe environment to keep fit and healthy.
I believe this website is beneficial to a client because its got detailed information on upcoming events and classes and any details an expected client could want to know about when they wish to join Fitness studio.

Features Left to Implement
I think what would be  a great feature to implement in the future is a log in account for memberships where they can track progress and food intake and have direct contact with coaches through the page and can leave notes on other clients walls with motivation or express gratitude
